# FighterRoster

This project was made using React through `npm create-react-app` and displays "fighters" in a style similar
to the Super Smash Bros. series of video games.

The `build` folder contains the minified, exectutable version
of the files I coded in React. The original files that I created are located in `Main Files/src` (with the 
exception of the `registerServiceWorker.js`, the `.woff` and the `.otf` files, and the image files). All
other files in `Main Files` were preset by `create-react-app`.

In order to view this project you need `npm` and you must follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

2. Open the repo folder in the terminal

3. Run `serve -s build`
   (If you do not have `serve`, use `npm install -g serve`)
   
4. Copy either link given by `serve` onto the address bar in your browser and press Enter
